# Reform Priorities #

This directory contains some basic documentation:

- XML example data
- XSD schema


## XML Data Format ##

The most precise specification of the format is the `reformpri.xsd` schema. 
If you are learning the format or developing an XML data file, we suggest using an tool which can check validity with 
one click, such as  [XML Copy Editor](http://xml-copy-editor.sourceforge.net/). Like many XML editors, 
it will auto-fill tags as you go, check them for balance, and various other tasks to make writing XML simple and quick.

Note that we follow the practice of using only XML Elements, not Attributes. The latter are more compact to write,
but much more difficult to modify later. We can represent a dog's color as either an Element or an Attribute:

- Elements: `<dog> <color>Black</color> </dog>`
- Attributes: `<dog color="Black"/>`

The basic elements of the data file are the following:

- Scenario name and description
- govBudget: a positive decimal between 0 and 100.
- outOfBudget factor: a positive decimal between 0 and 1.
- orderFactor:  a positive decimal between 0 and 1.
- Items: a list of name and cost pairs.
	- Name: a short, 2-5 character label
	- Cost: a positive decimal between 0 and 100.
- Categories: a list of names
- Actors
	- Name: a short, 2-5 character label, e.g. "PF"
	- Description: a longer description, e.g. "President of the Federation"
	- Capability: a positive number between 0 and 100.
	- ItemValues: a list of values for each item, in the same order as the items themselves. Each item value is a decimal between 0 and 100 (possibly zero).
