The file 'dummyData_3Dim.csv" was SAVED AS an "XML Spreadsheet 2003" to get it into XML.


The resulting XML had this as its first three lines:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?mso-application progid="Excel.Sheet"?>
<Workbook xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet"

However, the second line <?mso-application ... ?> caused TinyXML2 to crash.
Therefore, I had to remove that line so that the file started as follows:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Workbook xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet"

Then it worked just fine. The top-level structure is simple:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Workbook >
 <DocumentProperties ...>
 <OfficeDocumentSettings ...>
 <ExcelWorkbook ...>
 <Styles ...>
 <Worksheet>
  <Table >
   <Row>
    <Cell ...>
    <Cell ...>
    <Cell ...>
    <Cell ...>
    <Cell ...>
  </Row>
  <Row>
    ...
  </Row>
  ...
 </Worksheet>
 <WorksheetOptions ...>
</Workbook>

Because of the way TinyXML2's FirstChildElement function works,
we could skip the properties, settings, styles, etc. when generating
data files and it would still be alright.
